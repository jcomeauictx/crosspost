# crosspost
post photos from any Instagram feed to your Facebook page

I did this for a client on a freelancing site, but he refused to pay because Facebook weirdness was preventing the posts from showing up in his own country, though they showed everywhere else in the world. so I'm sharing it as an example of a simple use of both APIs.

when using the Makefile to get your never-expiring key, w3m as the browser may
not work for the first Oauth phase. in that case use Firefox or some other
browser: `make BROWSER=firefox code`. the remaining steps should work fine with a text browser like w3m.

you can use any CGI script on any server, including localhost, to capture the
strings. just make sure it shows you environment strings and anything coming in from stdin.
